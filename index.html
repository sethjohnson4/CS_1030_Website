<h1>SquatCode</h1>
<p><a href="https://squatcode.com">Squatcode</a> is a small company that centers around creating custom software solutions. It is currently under development.<br>
Squatcode is also currently working on an upcoming project called squatmath. Squatmath will be an easily accessible tutoring website for Utah schools.</p>

<h2>What SquatCode is all about</h2>
<p>Squatcode is here to help small businesses in the Ogden area with all of their sofware needs. It is unreasonable for a small company to hire a team of software developers, when they really only need a few custom solutions for their company. Squatcode is here to solve his issue. Squatcode is a team of four Weber State University graduates and students that are looking for more experience in the software industry. By going through squatcode you will benefit to a more personalized and local experience. Squatcode is also here mainly to give its four members experience in the tech industry. Because of this we will likely not even charge our customers.</p>
